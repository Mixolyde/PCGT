The Procedural Content Generation Toolkit
created by: Brian E. Williams

This Erlang toolkit is intended to be a library of useful modules for creating
procedural content based on some common algorithms for generating noise and other systems.

Planned Implementations:
Simplex Noise in 2d, 3d and 4d
Worley Noise in 2d
L-Systems
Cellular Automata Systems

For each system I plan to have
* Reproducible and seedable generation
* Good documentation on usage and types
* Fast, efficient algorithms
* Selectable algorithms for some modules
* A re-usable Octave system for combining multiple levels of noise at different scales
* Citations and references for algorithms and descriptions
* Example usage (heightmaps, tree structures, maps/mazes, etc)

Completed:
* Still working on file layout and library stuff
* Some of 2d simplex noise converted from java
